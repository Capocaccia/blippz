2. Run the following command: composer install && cd frontend && npm install
3. Make sure you have a localhost mysql instance up and running
4. Run the database migrations from app root: php artisan migrate
5. touch .env
6. Copy the .env.example file to .env and plug in your db user credentials for the database
